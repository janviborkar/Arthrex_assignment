##Counter Part of Word Finder
This Python script is designed to find and suggest words from a list that match a given pattern. The pattern can include wildcard characters (*) that represent any sequence of characters.

##How It Works
The script takes a comma-separated string of words as input and splits it into a list of words.
It then takes a search pattern string as input. The search pattern can include the * character, which acts as a wildcard.
The script converts the search pattern into a regular expression.
It finds and returns all words from the list that match the regular expression.
